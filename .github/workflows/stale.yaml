            There hasn't been any activity on this issue recently. To keep the
            number of open issues under control, we have to clean some of the
            old issues, as many of them have already been resolved with the
            latest updates.

            Please make sure to update to the latest Yale Access Bluetooth
            Activity version and check if that solves the issue. Let us know if
            that works for you by adding a comment 👍

            This issue has now been marked as stale and will be closed if no
            further activity occurs. Thank you for your contributions.
